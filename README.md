# SIC-Bank-System
SIC Bank System is a simple console-based banking application built with Python. It allows users to register, login, and manage accounts using a secure ID and password. The system supports deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers between accounts, with multi-currency support (EGP, USD, SAR) using fixed conversion rates.

All customer data, including account details and balances, is stored in a JSON file to ensure persistence between sessions. For privacy, passwords are hidden when displaying user information.

This project demonstrates basic file handling, exception handling, and data management in Python, making it a practical example for beginners in programming and software development
